library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

#
```{r}
sum(duplicated(upd_uwoman))
upd_uwoman[upd_uwoman=='']
upd_uwoman<-upd_uwoman %>% modify(outlier)
colSums(is.na(upd_uwoman))
median(UWOMAN$cowives)
upd_uwoman<-upd_uwoman %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,~replace_na(.,median(.,na.rm=T)))
```

1.Import the excel file/data into R. Save it as UWOMAN.
```{r}
UWOMAN <- read_excel("C:/Project D.S/assignment/Assignment3data.xlsx", sheet = "data")
View(UWOMAN)
str(UWOMAN)
UWOMAN$relig<-as.factor(UWOMAN$relig)
levels(UWOMAN$relig)
```
2.Define and assign value labels for the different qualitative variables. 
```{r}
upd_uwoman<-UWOMAN %>% mutate(region=factor(region,levels = 1:4,labels = c("North","East","West","Central")),resd=factor(resd,levels = 1:2,labels = c("Rural","Urban")),educl=factor(educl,levels=1:3,labels=c("None","Primary","Tertiary")), relig.f=factor(relig,levels = c("Anglican","Muslim","Other","RC"  ),labels = 1:4),assoc=factor(assoc,levels = 0:1,labels = c("doesn't belong","Belong")))

```

3.Compute the average, minimum and maximum number of Children ever born 
```{r}
str(upd_uwoman)
summary(upd_uwoman$ceb)
```

4.Which percentage of the respondents are Muslims and which percentage are Catholics.
```{r}
upd_uwoman %>% group_by(relig) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% mutate(perc=n*100/sum(n)) %>% filter(relig%in%c("Muslim","RC")) %>% select(-n)
```
5.Generate a new variable fertility status whereby if number of children born is less than 4, they are infertile, 4 to 8, fertile and above 8 children they are very fertile. What percentage of the respondents are fertile?
```{r}
woman<-upd_uwoman %>% mutate(fertility_status=car::recode(ceb,'0:3="infertile";4:8="fertile";else="veryfertile"'))
woman %>% count(fertility_status) %>% mutate(perc=n*100/sum(n)) %>% filter(fertility_status=="fertile")
```

6.Compare the age at first marriage across various religious affiliations.
```{r}
m<-woman %>% group_by(agefm,relig) %>% summarise(no.women=n(),.groups = "drop")
woman %>% group_by(agefm,relig) %>% summarise(no.women=n(),.groups = "drop")
ggplot(m,aes(no.women,agefm,colour=relig))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(facets = vars(relig))+theme_bw()
```

7.Is there any association between religion and education level?
```{r}
woman$relig.f<-as.integer(woman$relig.f)
woman$educl.f<-as.numeric(woman$educl)
summary(lm(educl.f~relig,data = woman))
#there is no association between education level and religion since the p-value is greater than the level of significance hence not statistically significant
```

8.Which percentage of the Muslims belong to an association?
```{r}
woman %>% count(relig,assoc) %>% filter(relig%in%"Muslim")
```

9.With the help of a pie-chart, which percentage have primary and which percentage have tertiary education level?
```{r}
chart<- woman %>% count(educl) %>% mutate(perc=n/sum(n),education_level=educl)
ggplot(chart,aes(x="",y=perc,fill=education_level))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 1)+  coord_polar("y",start=1)+
  theme_void()+
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(perc)),position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))

```
10.	Test whether there exists significant difference in age at first marriage between those that belong to an association and those that donâ€™t.

#hypothesis
h0:Their does not exist a difference between the means in the assoc, mean difference=0
h1:Their exist a difference between the means in the assoc

```{r}
plot(agefm~assoc,data=woman)
MW<-t.test(agefm~assoc,data=woman)
MW$p.value
0.1955273

#we reject the null hypothesis since the pvalue is greater than the level of significance hence not statistically significant to support that the mean difference is 0
```

11.Test whether there is a significant relationship between number of children born and age

#Hypothesis
H0:Their exist a significant rlship between age and children born
H1:Their does not exist a significant rlship between age and children born
```{r}
plot(ceb~age,data=woman)
model_wom<-lm(ceb~age,data=woman)
summary(model.wom)
#We fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is less than the levels of significance hence statistically significant 
```

12.Is there a significant mean difference in number of children born by religious affiliation? Which group produces more children than the others and which groups are significantly different from each other.

#hypothesis
h0:Their does not exist a difference between the means in the religion affliation, mean difference=0
h1:Their exist a difference between the means in the religion affliation
```{r}
boxplot(ceb~relig,data=woman)
# we get a vitualization view of the difference in means
model_p<-lm(ceb~relig,data = woman)
summary(model_p)
#We reject the null hypothesis since p-value > level of significance hence not statistically significant to approve difference in the means is 0

woman %>% group_by(relig) %>% summarise(sum_ceb=sum(ceb))
#the Anglicans 
```
13.Does the choice to belong to an association depend on age and education level? 
```{r}
#as.numeric(woman$assoc)
model_k<-glm(assoc~age+educl,woman,family = "binomial")
summary(model_k)

```



14.	Does number of co-wives depend on religious affiliation?
H0:The difference in mean is 0
H1:the mean difference is not equal to 0
```{r}
model_b<-lm(cowives~relig,data = woman)
summary(model_b)
#we reject the null hypothesis since the pvalue is greater than the level of significance hence not statistically significant to support that the mean difference is 0
```
15.	Regress children ever born on age and interpret your results.
H0:The difference in mean is 0
H1:the mean difference is not equal to 0
```{r}
ggplot(woman,aes(age,ceb))+geom_point()
Mod_b<-lm(ceb~age,data = woman)
summary(Mod_b)
#We fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p-value is less than the levels of significance hence statistically significant 
#Multiple R-squared indicates that the independent variable(age) can account 61% of the  dependent variable(children ever born)
```
